module AdjRIBOut where

{-
 - AdjRIBOut provdes a list structure to support route dissemination
 - every peer has its own AdjRIBOut in order to allow each peer to consume Updates at its own pace
 - an optimisation to suppress duplicate updates due to slow consumption can be implnented outside this API
 - using the route identity which is stored with the prefix set
 - the structure is a simple list which holds a set of prefixes
 - prefixes are grouped to maintain packing of prefixes within a single update message
 - fixing up fragmentation of prefixes over common routes is not attempted because it is unlikely to be useful
 - the exception is in the event of route reefersh or peer session initilisation,
 - when an entire route table must be exchanged
